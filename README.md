Noria Wordpress Theme Files

Developed as a part of a university project for Content Development Project.  Noria was a real client (and a real jazz singer)!

Worked as a developer and as the project manager of three others on this task.  As a group, we held a requirements gathering session with the client, ensuring to communicate clearly.  The client required a website she could update herself and could serve as a press kit when pitching for gigs.

The designers came up with the treatment in the form of a Photoshop flatfile and I worked with them to translate it into a custom Wordpress theme.

We were "competing" against another team for the client, and we were successful.

Assets such as images and sound not included.
